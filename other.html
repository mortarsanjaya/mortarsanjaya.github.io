<h3><a href="https://github.com/mortarsanjaya/IMOSLLean4">Formalization of IMO Shortlist Problems</a></h3>

<p>
I have formalized some of the IMO Shortlist problems in Lean.
For some of the problems, this also includes <b>their generalizations</b>.
Unfortunately, I do not know how to formalize the problems in the geometry category.
Sorry, but geometry gets benched this time!
</p>
<p>
I will still try to keep the project up to date, but only occasionally.
</p>
<p>
I am currently not interested in extending the range of formalization outside of the IMO Shortlist.
