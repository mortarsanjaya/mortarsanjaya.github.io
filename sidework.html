<h3><a href="https://github.com/mortarsanjaya/IMOSLLean4">Formalization of IMO Shortlist Problems</a></h3>

<p>
I have formalized some of the IMO Shortlist problems in Lean.
This include not just the problems itself, but also <b>their generalizations</b>.
Unfortunately, I do not know how to formalize the problems in the geometry category.
I apologize to the geometry fans, but geometry is benched this time!

This project will not be updated very often and most likely will be outdated, but I will still try to keep it up to date.
