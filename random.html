<h1 align="center">Random Rambling</h1>

This page is very small right now; I might add things later on.



<h3>Chess</h3>

I used to play Bullet 1+1 on <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a>, but now I'm only doing puzzles.

Update: I'm going back to play chess, mainly Bullet 1+1, but also Rapid 10+0.



<h3>Pok&eacute;mon</h3>

I enjoy competitive Poke&eacute;mon and also the Mystery Dungeon series.
The Explorers series has some really good OSTs, and both Explorers and Rescue Team has great stories in my opinion.
I also play some competitive Pok&eacute;mon on online servers; nowadays I just play random battles.
